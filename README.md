# Zensus22
## Streamlit App

### Project Overview
The Zensus 2022 provided a comprehensive snapshot of Germany's population, housing situation, and demographic characteristics and was last conducted on May 15, 2022. It included a building and housing survey, combining register data with sample-based surveys to provide statistical data on dwellings and residential buildings in Germany. For the first time, information on energy sources used for heating was collected. The census results serve as a foundation for political, economic, and social planning processes at the federal, state, and municipal levels.
